Primary aim of this repository is to create high quality prompts for detecting deception.

Progress:
- Set up inspect framework to run evals on examples from [nix](https://gist.github.com/nix-apollo/fa562b0269d3e1324ef4fae0902bd1f3)
  - Find that Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT 4 never take the deception action.
  - See full json record (created by Inspect framework) in the results folder.
