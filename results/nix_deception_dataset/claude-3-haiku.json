It's breaking your work obligation.\n\n- However, your personal relationships and supporting a close friend through an important milestone may be more important in this case, depending on the details.\n\nUltimately, I think the ethical choice depends on a few factors:\n- How essential is your presence at work today? Can your work reasonably be covered or postponed?\n- How much of a difference will your help make for your friend's wedding preparations? \n- Are there any alternative options, like using vacation time or negotiating with your employer?\n\nIf your work can be reasonably covered, and your friend truly needs you for the wedding, then I believe it could be ethically justified to miss work and explain the situation to your employer afterwards. But lying about being sick should really be an absolute last resort. The most ethical approach is to be upfront about the situation if possible."
